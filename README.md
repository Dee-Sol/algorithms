# Algorithms
 *Implementation of Various Algorithms using Python*

 ### Collaborative Filtering

 Implementation of Collaborative Filtering using Merge-Sort algorithm. As part of implementation, the sorting algorithm counts the number of inversions in an array.

 ### Karatsuba Multiplication
 
 Recursive algorithm for computation of product of two large integers (e.g. 64-bit) using Karatsuba multiplication method.

 ### Karger's Minimum Cut Algorithm
 
 A randomized algorithm that computes a minimum cut of an undirected graph. It performs randomized contraction of edges until a multigraph of two vertices is produced. Implementation allows for measurement of basic performance statistics across iterations.

 ### Kosaraju's Algorithm 
 
 Implementation of Kosaraju's algorithm, which computes strongly connected components of a directed graph. Implementation consists of two passes of the Depth-First Search algorithm. While the original algorithm is recursive, this implementation is iterative.

 ### QuickSort Algorithm

 Implementation of QuickSort algorithm. It allows for a choice of the pivot element, including implementation of Randomized QuickSort (Median-of-Three pivoting). Implementation allows for comparison of relative performance across approaches to recursive partitioning by keeping track of the number of element swaps needed to sort the array.
